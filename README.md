#  Bonny Note

It's a simple note application that built with Javascript & Webpack. I used [Quill](https://github.com/quilljs/quill) text editor for this application.

Also, I created a fake rest API with  [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) library.

## Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/feyyazakkus/bonny-note.git
npm intall
npm start
```
